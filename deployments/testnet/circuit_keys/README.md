# Testnet circuit keys

This directory contains the Groth16 key material used by the testnet deployment.

- `policy_tx_2_2_*` — keys for the on-chain transaction circuit (used by the pool contract).
- `selectiveDisclosure_1_*` — keys for the off-chain selective-disclosure receipt circuit.

Notes:
- `testdata/` remains a local/generated workspace directory (and is
  ignored by git). Tests may still read keys from there.
- Changing the `policy_tx_2_2` keys requires redeploying the on-chain verifier
  and any dependent contracts.
- Changing the `selectiveDisclosure_1` keys requires a web app rebuild and an
  updated pinned `vk_hash`; it does not require a contract redeploy.

## Selective disclosure circuit (`selectiveDisclosure_1`)

Files:
- `selectiveDisclosure_1_proving_key.bin` — compressed arkworks Groth16 proving key.
- `selectiveDisclosure_1_vk.json` — snarkjs-compatible verifying key exported from the proving key above.

**Provenance caveat:** Unlike `policy_tx_2_2`, this disclosure key pair was **locally generated** (not produced by a trusted ceremony). It is suitable for testnet/off-chain disclosure receipts only.

**Canonical `vk_hash`:** `0xe8c9879c1239deeaab3cda366419e3536a6f66502f88c3eec09da1e52843e5af`

This hash is `disclosure::vk_hash_hex` over the **compressed arkworks verifying-key bytes** (`VerifyingKey::serialize_compressed`), not the SHA-256 of the JSON file. The same value is pinned in `app/js/disclosure.js` and `docs/src/disclosure.md`. For the full derivation steps and file checksums.

**Operational note:** Disclosure proof verification is entirely off-chain. Rotating this key requires rebuilding the web app and updating the pinned `vk_hash` in the UI/docs; it does **not** require a pool contract redeploy.
